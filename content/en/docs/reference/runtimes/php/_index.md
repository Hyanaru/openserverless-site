## Creating and invoking PHP actions

The process of creating PHP actions is similar to that of other actions.
The following sections guide you through creating and invoking a single PHP action,
and demonstrate how to bundle multiple PHP files and third party dependencies.

1. Create a Python_app folder and then create a `package` directory.Now create a Python file with the following content inside our `packages/php`. For this example, the file name is `hello.php`.

  ```php
<?php
//--web true
//--kind php:default
function main(array $args) : array
{
    $name = $args["name"] ?? "stranger";
    $greeting = "Hello $name!";
    echo $greeting;
    return ["greeting" => $greeting];
}
?>

  ```

  The PHP file might contain additional functions.
  However, by convention, a function called `main` must exist to provide the entry point for the action.

  Your directory structure should looks like this:

  ```shell
  PHP_app
  └── packages
      └── php
          └── hello.php

  ```
2. Run the following command to deploy the action
```bash
ops ide deploy
```

3. Ops will create the action automatically. For this example, the action is called `php/hello`.

  ```
    /home/openserverless.ops/tmp/deploy.pid
    PID 220917
    > Scan:
    >> Action: packages/php/hello.php
    > Deploying:
    >> Package: php
    $ $OPS package update php 
    ok: updated package php
    >>> Action: packages/php/hello.php
    $ $OPS action update php/hello packages/php/hello.php 
    ok: updated action php/hello
    build process exited with code 0
    UPLOAD ASSETS FROM web
    ==================| UPLOAD RESULTS |==================
    | FILES      : 0
    | COMPLETED  : 0
    | ERRORS     : 0
    | SKIPPED    : 0
    | EXEC. TIME : 2.61 ms
    ======================================================
    URL: http://openserverless.localhost:80
  ```

  Note: To use a specific version of Python runtime, change the kind property `--kind php:8.1`, or `--kind php:8.3` in the `hello.py` file.

4. To invoke the action run the following command:

```bash
ops action invoke php/hello --param name Marina --result
```

<!-- ## Packaging php actions in zip files
TODO: convert code for PHP
Sometimes you action would be more complex and probably you prefer to create multiple file in order to organize better your code.

In this example we're creating a more complex php action.

1. Create a folder `complex_action` inside `packages/php` folder. Then create two php files

index.php
  ```php
<?php
//--web true
//--kind php:default
include 'utils.php';

function main($args) {
    $name = isset($args['name']) ? $args['name'] : 'stranger';
    $result = concat_string('Nice to meet you,', $name);
    return array('greeting' => $result);
}
?>

  ```

utils.php
  ```php
<?php

function concat_string($first_string, $second_string) {
    return "$first_string $second_string";
}
?>
  ```

Note: The filename of the source file containing the entry point (e.g., `main`) must be `index.php`.

2. Deploy the action using `ide deploy`

```bash
ops ide deploy
```

3. Now you can invoke your action. In this case the action name is `php/complex_action`

```bash
ops action invoke php/complex_action --param name Marina --result
```
